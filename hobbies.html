        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p style="color:var(--muted);">Basketball has been a huge part of my life. It keeps me active, teaches teamwork, and sharpens my decision-making. I play pickup games at the RSOP center and try to practice shooting several times a week.</p>

        <h4>Personal stories</h4>
        <p style="color:var(--muted);">One of my favorite memories was during middle school basketball where we came back from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter. In fact, I was the one who made the game winner. That win taught me to be resilient, to be a leader, and always stay humble. This is just one of many personal stories I have. Feel free to reach out to me using my information given for more details!</p>
        <h4>Why it matters</h4>
        <p style="color:var(--muted);">Basketball keeps me balanced, helps with stress management, and gives me community away from schoolwork. I believe strongly in balancing work life, school life, and personal life. Basketball is one of the few things that allows me to escape from reality and be myself.</p>

        <h2>Golf</h2>
        <p style="color:var(--muted);">Golf is my outdoor escape. I enjoy the focus required for the short game and the satisfaction of a well-executed round. I play several local courses in the summer and practice at the range when I can.</p>

        <h4>Personal stories</h4>
        <p style="color:var(--muted);">I remember playing an early morning nine with a professor who gave me tips about course management — the experience reinforced how sports can connect you with people across disciplines.</p>
        <h4>Why it matters</h4>
        <p style="color:var(--muted);">Golf provides patience and discipline — qualities that translate well into finance and professional life.</p>
